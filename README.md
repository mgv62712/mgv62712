<h1>Why Hippos Are the Third Deadliest Animals in South Africa</h1>
<h2><strong>A Systematic Overview</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>	Why are hippos the third deadliest animal in South Africa behind the mosquito and the Puff Adder Snake? Well, if you look at the facts, the answer is simple. Almost everything about the hippos body and mind is designed for them to be a killing machine. As shown in the chart below, hippos kill about 2,900 Africans every year. With Africa becoming increasingly industrialized, many people are moving into land that is commonly ruled by hippos. This is bad news for humans because unlike other animals, hippos are pretty unwilling to move.</p>
<p>	Hippos, especially males, are extremely territorial. Hippos will fight just about anything in order to defend their land. In addition to being sensitive about their territory, they are also very quick to anger. They will flash their teeth when they feel any sort of threat just to show their opponent what they are capable of.In fact, their teeth are so big that just one hippo tooth can weigh up to 7 pounds! These teeth prove effective when paired with hippo’s extremely strong jaw bones that allow it to crush just about anything. In addition to all this, an angry hippo can also reach top speeds of around 30 miles per hour.</p>
<p> 	With all of these different factors combined and put into one animal it is easy to see why one should not mess with hippos. Sadly, hippo and human interaction is not slowing down. It is actually rising, due to a rapid population growth experienced in Africa causing people to expand their normal living quarters. So, these are all the reasons hippo’s are so deadly, and I don’t see their killing rates falling anytime soon!</p>
